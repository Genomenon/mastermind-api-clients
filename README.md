# Mastermind API Cookbook

This repository consists of sample scripts for interacting with the
Mastermind RESTful JSON API.

Each Python file in this repository contains a description of what the
file does and how to run it at the top of the file.

Engine, see [the live API demo and
documentation](https://mastermind.genomenon.com/api/).
